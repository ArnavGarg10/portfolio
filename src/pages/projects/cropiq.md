When I was young, my Mom gave me a simple task: grow any plant of my choosing in my garden until we can harvest it. I went to Home Depot and chose the first plant I saw; a zucchini. Just weeks after starting out, I hadn't checked on my plant in a few days, and was devastated to find that the entire plant was infested with pests, and would not be able to be used. If only I had been able to recognize when pests were infecting my plant early on, I could have saved it.

When I found out that Haitian farmers have loss estimates ranging from one-third for cereal grains and legumes to nearly 50% for fruits and vegetables due to pests, plant diseases, and other factors, I knew I had to act. That's why I made CropIQ, which delivers a suite of farming applications to farmers in Haiti to improve their crop yield, boost their economy, and give them another chance against their natural roadblocks.
