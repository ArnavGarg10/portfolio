According to a report published by the Pew Institute, only 6% of today's kids follow news about national and international issues very closely, and 23% follow the news fairly closely. We are the same as the majority of the kids who don't follow the news as much as regular adults. This is because often times the news that we kids receive is too complicated to understand. This is why we created NewsBuddies, an app that makes these articles more accessible for kids and personalizes the lexical complexity of headline articles based on their age.
