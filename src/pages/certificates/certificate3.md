I won the Best Research award at a local model UN conference, FHSMUNC 2024, in a committee related to AI data concerns. The chairs of that commitee, experienced in Model UN, decided that I had demonstrated the best writing and research skills, therefore I was awarded the Best Research award. I won this award out of a committee of around 15 delegates, all of whom were in high school besides me.
