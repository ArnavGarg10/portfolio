I won the Best Delegate award at a local model UN conference, miniMUN 2024, in a committee related to a crisis among the Avengers (Sokovia Accords). The chairs of that commitee, experienced in Model UN, decided that I had demonstrated the best public speaking skills and therefore, I was awarded the Best Delegate award.
